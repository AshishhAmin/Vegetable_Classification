# Vegetable Classification Model
- This is a simple model to classify different vegetable classes.Although I have trained this model with small number of datasets, we can add different vegetables and train the model for the same. 
- I have used Google Colab and Datasets were stored in Google drive.
- Dataset link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XPfvGPstOxuVjnMgO6e_IgYNf8cup3UA?usp=drive_link
   
Note: If dataset is stored in local system ,path must be set for the same.
